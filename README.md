# Employee-Atrittion


## Objective:
The objective of the present report is to study factors like salary, satisfactory level, growth opportunities, facilities, policies and procedures, recognition, appreciation, suggestions of the employee’s by which it helps to know the Attrition level in the organizations and factors relating to retain them. This study also helps to find out where the organizations are lagging in retaining.

**Hypothesis:** 
1.	Employee attrition increases costs of recruitment, hiring and training replacement in the industries. 
2.	Employee attrition reduces production, and profit in the industries. 

## Approach:
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. Naïve Bayes
4. K nearest neighbours

I tested the results produced using various combinations of number of dimensions and the above
mentioned techniques. The best accuracy was obtained with SVM and 29 dimensions.

## Suggested Action
* Improving the work conditions
  * Provide an option for the employee’s  to work from home, on a flexible schedule, or in an office with an ergonomic workspace, they will be more satisfied with their work and more likely to achieve a healthy work-life balance.
* Offer modest salaries and perks
  * To maintain the critical employee’s company need’s to offer equitable and modest salaries. You can also give added perks like flexible schedules, travel discounts etc.
* Employee Engagement
  * When you have talented employee’s we need to find ways that you can help expand the employee’s skill set, so that their involvement in the job increases. If their involvement is low, they will get bored and think that they are not growing within the organization

## Results and Learning
Highest accuracy I could achieve was 89%.
I got to learn basics of python. I learnt using pandas dataframes, and training models and predicting variables with them. Got to know about how much capabilities and ease do the libraries like scikitlearn provide us.
